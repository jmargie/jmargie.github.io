# Roman Anthony vs Juan Soto
## Quotes / Motivation
"Who he reminds me of, it's hard," Cora said, per The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal. "I don't want to say (Barry) Bonds, of course. Probably (Juan) Soto, without the flashiness, early on. It's a good at-bat. He's not going to chase. Even when he doesn't get hits, you're like, holy s---, that's a good at-bat" (SOURCE)
"Anthony is averaging 4.25 pitches per plate appearance," Rosenthal wrote. "His walk rate is 14.6 percent. In those categories ... he would rank among the league leaders if he had enough playing time."

"Players to rank in 95th percentile in hard-hit percentage and chase percentage in 2025, there's two of them. It's Juan Soto and Roman Anthony," Mark DeRosa shared on "MLB Central." (SOURCE)

It is easy to mislead people with statistics. I don't think the above people are attempting to mislead anyone, but comparing anyone to Juan Soto is a big deal! That changes a team! (Despite the 2025 Mets, unfortunately). Anthony is about my age, and despite the data not supporting it, I instinctually am fascinated by high walk rates in younger players (according to statcast, the relationship between age and bb% has an r2 of 0.01). 

So, let's take a look! Do those two statistics actually represent their style during a plate appearance? Is Roman Anthony the next Juan Soto?
